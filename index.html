            <h2>about</h2>
              <p> 
                I am currently 11 weeks into a full-time <span> Intensive Web Development bootcamp </span> with the New York Code and Design Academy (Philadelphia Campus). The main focuses are on HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Ruby, Rails, Git, ActiveRecord, Collaborative Development, and Database Theory. 
              </p>
              <p>
                With a background in <span> marketing, communications and branding, </span> I thoroughly enjoy the aesthetics and <span> visual creativity </span> of front-end development. However, I also appreciate working with the back-end (especially with Ruby on Rails!) to create a <span> seamless user experience </span>. I also have experience working well with clients (and being the client!). This combination of interests aligns well with <span>UI/UX </span> but I am open to many opportunities. 
              </p>
              <p>
                <span> Keep scrolling to see my class portfolio and contact information! </span>

            <h3> Ruby on Rails & Google Maps API </h3>
            <h3> Focus: object oriented programming </h3>
            <p> 
              JORTS is a location based app that allows users to find others in their area to do activities with. This was a final group assignment. I worked with another developer to create a Rails app that implemented all the things we've learned in the course. From collaborative software development to databases and CSS, we created JORTS in 6 days. JORTS specifically employed the google maps API to give users the capabilties to search activities in their area and create activities with specific locations.

            <h3> Javascript & Scss </h3>
            <h3> Focus: object oriented programming </h3>
            <p> 
              The assignment was to utilize Javascript, jQuery, HTML and Scss to develop a jukebox that could play, load, pause, stop, go to the next track and pick a random track. We themed this around a comedy club. The 'Jokebox' was created so people can hear great stand-up bits from some of their favorite comedians!

            <h3> Ruby on Rails </h3>
            <h3> Focus: databases and validations </h3>
            <p> 
              We were asked to create a project centered around the needs of shippers and to specifically showcase our proficiency with validations and join tables in our database. We catered ours to pirates and created a bit of a guessing game in the process. We pushed ourselves beyond the requirements by implementing a dynamic map for users to interact with.

            <h2>Birderz: Rails Blog</h2>
            <a href="https://github.com/EmilyMcCracken/Rails_Blog" target="_blank"><img class="project_img" src="stylesheets/images/birderz_app.png" alt=""></a>
            <h3> Ruby on Rails</h3>
            <h3> Focus: databases and MVC </h3>
            <p>
              This was our first step into Rails! We were asked to create a blog where users could log in, log out, create posts, comment on other's posts, etc. We wanted our blog to be a bit silly and have a specific niche so we chose to create a space for bird-watchers to connect with eachother! Users can sign-up, log in, create a profile, edit their profile, write a post, view other users' posts (on a feed), comment on posts, sign out and delete their accounts.
